<h1>Common Baby Rashes Explained: Milk Rash, Heat Rash & Eczema</h1>

<p>
  Baby skin is extremely delicate, which is why rashes are very common during the first few months of life.
  Most rashes are harmless and temporary, but they can still look worrying for new parents.
</p>

<p>
  This guide explains the three most common rashes seen in newborns and young babies: 
  <strong>milk rash, heat rash, and mild eczema</strong>. Each section covers causes, what the rash looks like,
  simple ways to care for your baby’s skin, and when you may want to seek advice.
</p>

<h2>Why Babies Get Rashes Easily</h2>

<p>
  A baby’s skin is about 30% thinner than adult skin, making it more sensitive to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>heat and humidity,</li>
  <li>friction from clothing,</li>
  <li>saliva and milk,</li>
  <li>new products,</li>
  <li>environmental changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Because of this, a simple change — like sweating, drooling, or a warm room — can trigger a rash.
  Most rashes disappear on their own with gentle care.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Milk Rash (Newborn Acne)</h2>

<p>
  Milk rash, sometimes called “newborn acne,” is one of the most common skin conditions in babies.
  Despite the name, it is <strong>not caused by breast milk or formula</strong>.
</p>

<h3>What Milk Rash Looks Like</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Small red or white bumps on the cheeks, nose, or chin</li>
  <li>May appear slightly inflamed</li>
  <li>Often comes and goes throughout the day</li>
  <li>Worse when baby is hot or irritable</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It often appears at:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>2–4 weeks old</li>
  <li>and usually disappears by 2–3 months</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Causes Milk Rash?</h3>

<p>
  The exact cause isn’t fully known, but experts believe it may be linked to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>maternal hormones passed during pregnancy,</li>
  <li>immature pores that easily get blocked,</li>
  <li>baby’s sensitive skin reacting to heat or moisture.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Care for Milk Rash</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Gently cleanse with warm water once a day</li>
  <li>Pat the skin dry — avoid rubbing</li>
  <li>Do not apply oily lotions</li>
  <li>Keep baby cool and dry</li>
  <li>Use soft, breathable fabrics</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Milk rash usually clears on its own without any treatment. Avoid squeezing or scrubbing the bumps.
</p>

<h3>When to Seek Advice</h3>

<p>
  Reach out for guidance if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rash spreads aggressively,</li>
  <li>you see yellow crusting or oozing,</li>
  <li>the rash lasts beyond 3 months.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Heat Rash (Prickly Heat)</h2>

<p>
  Heat rash, or “prickly heat,” happens when sweat gets trapped in baby’s skin.
  Because babies cannot regulate their body temperature well, they overheat easily — especially in warm climates.
</p>

<h3>What Heat Rash Looks Like</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Tiny red bumps or clear blisters</li>
  <li>Clusters of rash on neck, chest, armpits, or groin</li>
  <li>Sometimes itchy or prickly</li>
  <li>Appears more during hot, humid weather</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Causes of Heat Rash</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Overdressing or too many layers</li>
  <li>Hot and humid environments</li>
  <li>Sleeping in a warm room with poor ventilation</li>
  <li>Sweating in car seats or carriers</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Heat rash is extremely common in tropical countries and often appears when the weather suddenly becomes warmer.
</p>

<h3>How to Care for Heat Rash</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Move baby to a cooler, well-ventilated area</li>
  <li>Remove extra clothing layers</li>
  <li>Use lightweight, breathable fabrics (cotton)</li>
  <li>Give baby a lukewarm bath to cool the skin</li>
  <li>Allow the skin to air-dry</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Heat rash usually improves within 24–48 hours once baby’s skin stays cool.
</p>

<h3>What to Avoid</h3>

<ul>
  <li>No thick lotions or oils that trap heat</li>
  <li>No powder directly on the skin</li>
  <li>No tight-fitting clothes</li>
  <li>No heavy blankets during naps</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to Seek Advice</h3>

<p>
  Heat rash is normally mild, but get guidance if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>baby seems very uncomfortable or itchy,</li>
  <li>rash becomes swollen, painful, or infected,</li>
  <li>rash does not improve after cooling the environment.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)</h2>

<p>
  Mild eczema is common in babies, usually appearing after 3 months of age,
  though some babies develop it earlier. Eczema is <strong>not an allergy by itself</strong>,
  but sensitive skin can react easily to triggers.
</p>

<h3>What Baby Eczema Looks Like</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dry, rough, or flaky patches of skin</li>
  <li>Red, inflamed areas</li>
  <li>Itchy spots causing rubbing or fussiness</li>
  <li>Patches on cheeks, scalp, elbows, or behind knees</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Eczema can come and go — some days look worse, and other days it improves naturally.
</p>

<h3>Common Eczema Triggers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dry air or hot weather</li>
  <li>Rough fabrics like wool</li>
  <li>Fragrances in soaps or detergents</li>
  <li>Saliva from drooling</li>
  <li>Dust or environmental irritants</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Care for Mild Baby Eczema</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use gentle, fragrance-free cleansers</li>
  <li>Moisturize regularly with baby-safe creams</li>
  <li>Keep baby's nails short to prevent scratching</li>
  <li>Dress baby in soft, breathable fabrics</li>
  <li>Maintain a cool room temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Many babies outgrow eczema by age 1–2 as their skin becomes stronger.
</p>

<h3>When to Seek Advice</h3>

<p>
  Speak to a healthcare professional if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>eczema spreads rapidly,</li>
  <li>patches ooze or show signs of infection,</li>
  <li>baby seems extremely itchy or uncomfortable,</li>
  <li>skin becomes cracked or bleeding.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Tell the Difference Between Milk Rash, Heat Rash & Eczema</h2>

<p>Here's a simple comparison to help parents understand each condition:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>Type of Rash</th>
    <th>Appearance</th>
    <th>Common Locations</th>
    <th>Key Triggers</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Milk Rash</td>
    <td>Small red/white bumps</td>
    <td>Cheeks, chin, nose</td>
    <td>Hormones, heat, saliva</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heat Rash</td>
    <td>Tiny red bumps, blisters</td>
    <td>Neck, chest, armpits</td>
    <td>Heat, humidity, sweating</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eczema</td>
    <td>Dry, red, flaky patches</td>
    <td>Cheeks, arms, legs</td>
    <td>Sensitive skin, dryness</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  This comparison shows that while rashes may look similar,
  their causes and care methods differ slightly.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>General Skin Care Tips for All Rashes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Keep baby’s skin dry and cool</li>
  <li>Use gentle baby-safe products</li>
  <li>Avoid overdressing</li>
  <li>Bathe baby in lukewarm water</li>
  <li>Pat dry — never rub</li>
  <li>Choose loose, breathable clothing</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Good daily skin care reduces irritation and prevents rashes from worsening.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>When a Rash Needs Immediate Attention</h2>

<p>
  Most baby rashes are harmless. However, seek guidance if you notice:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>fever with rash,</li>
  <li>rash spreading rapidly,</li>
  <li>blisters filled with yellow or green fluid,</li>
  <li>rash that looks infected,</li>
  <li>baby very irritable or difficult to soothe,</li>
  <li>rash accompanied by poor feeding or dehydration.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Trust your instincts — if something feels unusual, it’s okay to ask for help.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
  Baby rashes are extremely common and usually not a cause for alarm.
  Milk rash, heat rash, and mild eczema are conditions that often improve with simple skin care and patience.
  By understanding what each rash looks like and how to care for it, parents can feel more confident and
  better prepared when these issues appear.
</p>

<p>
  With gentle care, a cool environment, and soft fabrics, most rashes clear up quickly and your baby’s
  skin returns to its natural softness.
