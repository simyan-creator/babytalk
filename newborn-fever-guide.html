<h1>Newborn Fever: What’s Normal &amp; When Parents Should Worry</h1>

<p>
  Caring for a newborn can be overwhelming, especially when your baby feels warmer than usual or seems uncomfortable.
  One of the most common concerns among new parents is fever. It can be frightening, but understanding what is normal
  and what requires medical attention can help you stay calm and make the right decisions.
</p>

<p>
  This guide breaks down everything in a simple, parent-friendly way — what counts as a fever, common causes, home
  observations you can safely make, and when it may be time to seek help.
</p>

<h2>What Is Considered a Fever in Newborns?</h2>

<p>
  For newborns and babies under 3 months, a fever is generally defined as:
</p>

<p><strong>A rectal temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) or higher.</strong></p>

<p>
  Rectal readings are the most reliable for newborns because ear, forehead, and armpit readings can be inaccurate.
</p>

<h2>Why Fever Happens in Newborns</h2>

<p>Not all fevers mean something is seriously wrong. Fever is the body's natural response to many things, including:</p>

<h3>1. Viral infections</h3>
<p>The most common cause. Babies can catch mild viruses easily from adults or siblings.</p>

<h3>2. Overheating</h3>
<p>Too many layers, blankets, or a warm room can raise a baby’s temperature.</p>

<h3>3. Immunizations</h3>
<p>A mild fever for 24–48 hours after vaccines is normal.</p>

<h3>4. Dehydration</h3>
<p>Poor feeding or vomiting can lead to slightly higher temperature.</p>

<h3>5. Normal fluctuations</h3>
<p>Newborns can’t regulate body temperature well, so small changes are common.</p>

<h2>Signs Your Baby Might Have a Fever</h2>

<p>Besides temperature, watch for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Warm chest or back</li>
  <li>Fussiness or irritability</li>
  <li>Unusual sleepiness</li>
  <li>Poor feeding</li>
  <li>Crying more than usual</li>
  <li>Reduced wet diapers</li>
  <li>Difficulty settling</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Check Your Baby’s Temperature Safely</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Use a digital thermometer.</li>
  <li>Rectal readings are most accurate for newborns.</li>
  <li>Lubricate the tip gently.</li>
  <li>Hold baby’s thighs together to keep still.</li>
  <li>Wait for the beep and read carefully.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Home Observations You Can Make</h2>

<h3>1. Clothing and environment</h3>
<p>Remove extra layers if baby seems too warm.</p>

<h3>2. Feeding habits</h3>
<p>Normal feeding is usually a good sign.</p>

<h3>3. Diapers</h3>
<p>4–6 wet diapers a day is normal for newborns.</p>

<h3>4. Alertness</h3>
<p>If baby is responsive and wakes normally, it’s reassuring.</p>

<h3>5. Breathing</h3>
<p>Watch for unusually fast or difficult breathing.</p>

<h2>When Fever is NOT Serious</h2>

<p>Fever may be mild and temporary if caused by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vaccinations</li>
  <li>Overdressing</li>

</ul>

<h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>

<p><strong>Seek help immediately if your baby under 3 months has a fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or higher.</strong></p>

  <li>Baby is unusually sleepy</li>
  <li>Baby refuses to feed</li>

  <li>Keep room cool (23–26°C)</li>
  <li>Use lukewarm sponge bath if needed</li>

<h2>Why Fever Can Be More Serious in Newborns</h2>

  <li>Limit visitors early on</li>
  <li>Avoid contact with sick family members</li>

  temperature, behavior, feeding, and diapers. Seek help if you see warning signs, especially in babies under 3 months.
  Parents who stay attentive and informed are already doing an excellent job caring for their newborn.
